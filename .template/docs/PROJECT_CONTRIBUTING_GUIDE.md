## What to Include

A good CONTRIBUTING.md typically includes:

### 1. **Welcome Message**

Link to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md or state expectations.

### 3. **How to Contribute**

```

### 5. **Coding Standards**

- [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## This Scaffolding's Contributing Policy

The scaffolding itself (`.template/CONTRIBUTING.md`) states we don't accept PRs. 
This is because it's a personal template.

**Your project is different!** You should:
1. Create your own `CONTRIBUTING.md` in project root
2. Define your own contribution policy
3. Customize based on your project needs
